.Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/dNVazZ/.

.Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

.User Story: I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.

.User Story: I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.

.User Story: I can click into any of those recipes to view it.

.User Story: I can edit these recipes.

.User Story: I can delete these recipes.

.User Story: All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.

.Hint: You should prefix your local storage keys on CodePen, i.e. _username_recipes

.Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

.When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

.You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
